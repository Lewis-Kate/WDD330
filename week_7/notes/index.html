    <p>Further Functions</p>
        <li>functions arefirst-class objects</li>
        <li>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument</li>
        <li>If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but you need provide null as its first argument</li>
        <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expression– or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it’s defined</li>
        <li>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any other part of the program</li>
        <li>recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met</li>
        <li>Collatz Conjecture - every positive integer will create a sequence that finishes in this loop</li>
        <li> 'spaghetti code' -  more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a large number of nested blocks that are difficult to comprehend</li>
        <li>Callback hell is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code</li>
        <li>Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors</li>
        <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions</li>
        <li>A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was originally defined in</li>
    
    <p>AJAX</p>
        <li> a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading</li>
        <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON</li>
        <li>requests can be made using the Fetch API</li>
        <li>can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request</li><br>
