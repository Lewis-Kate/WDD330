        <li>submit - most important form event</li>
        <li>document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page</li>
        <li>form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form</li>

    <p>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</p>
        <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods</li>
        <li> main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance</li>
        <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects</li>
        <li>ES6 introduced class declarations that use the class keyword. These can be used in place of constructor functions</li>
        <li>the keyword this refers to the object returned by the function</li>
        <li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype</li>
        <li>Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This should be done with caution as it can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work</li>
        <li>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation</li>
        <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects.
            
    <p>Modern JavaScript Development</p>
        <li>JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve</li>
        <li>jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions</li>
        <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules</li>
        <li>Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size</li>
        <li>Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool</li>
